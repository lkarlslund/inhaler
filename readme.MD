# inhaler

Inhales plaintext passwords, exhales hashed passwords ... at speed

## Usage

```
inhaler [--hash ntml] [--parallel 4] [--input filename.txt] [--output hashed.txt]
```

Will use stdin / stdout if you're not passing filenames, but it's not as fast as using files directly.

Only supports x64 systems for performance reasons.
